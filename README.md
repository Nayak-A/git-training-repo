# Git Hands-On Training

**Version Control with Git**


---

## Session Goals

- Understand Git basics and daily workflows
- Practice staging, committing, branching, and merging
- Resolve merge conflicts with confidence
- Learn how to explore Git help and documentation

---
<!-- _class: follow-along -->
<!-- _footer: üü¢ Follow Along -->

## Follow Along
Copy the commands or type them out and practice together
```bash
echo Hello World
```

---

## Introduction to Git

**What is it?**
- Distributed version control system
- Tracks changes in source code
- Enables collaboration

**Why use it?**
- Code history
- Branching for features
- Easy collaboration and rollback

<!-- Popular platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket -->

- **Repository**: Project folder with `.git` directory
- **Branch**: A copy of the code for making changes safely without affecting others
- **Remote**: Git repo hosted online (e.g. platforms, GitHub, Azure DevOps, BitBucket)
- **Staging**: Preparing changes to be included in the next commit
- **Commit**: A saved version of your code with a message explaining the change
- **Merge**: Combine changes from one branch into another

---

## Git Setup

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```
Initializes identity for commits. Remove `--global` to set identity for current repo only.


```bash
git init  # Create a new repo
git clone <url>  # Clone an existing repo
```

---

# Fork Training Repo


---
<!-- _class: follow-along -->
<!-- _footer: üü¢ Follow Along -->


## Cloning the Repository

Clone the training repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/git-training-repo.git
```
Navigate to the clone repo and opens the directory in VS Code

```bash
cd git-training-repo
code . 
```

---

## Sparse Checkout
**Partial Cloning**
Clone with `--filter=blob:none`, this
> will filter out all blobs (file contents) until needed by Git [_(git-scm)_](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---filterfilter-spec)
```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none <url>
```

**Sparse Checkouts**
Filter the checkouts to just specified directories
```bash
git sparse-checkout set [dir1]
```

---

## Branching

```bash
git branch
```
```bash
git switch <branch> # git checkout <branch>
```
```bash
git switch -c <branch> # git checkout -b <branch>
```

üåø Use branches to develop features independently

---
<!-- _class: follow-along -->
<!-- _footer: üü¢ Follow Along -->

## Your Personal Branch

Create a branch to make changes in
```bash
git switch -c test/feature_branch_1
```

---

## Remote Collaboration

```bash
git remote -v
```
```bash
git fetch
git pull
```
```bash
git push
```

üåç Work with centralized repos (e.g., GitHub)

---
<!-- _class: follow-along -->
<!-- _footer: üü¢ Follow Along -->

## Publish Your Branch

Push your branch to remote
```bash
git push
```
Git doesn't know which remote repository to push to
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin test/feature_branch_1
```

---

## Basic Workflow

1. Modify a file
2. Stage the change
3. Commit with a message
4. Push to remote

```bash
git status 
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push
```

---
<!-- _class: follow-along -->
<!-- _footer: üü¢ Follow Along -->

## Stage, Commit, and Push Changes

Open `src.txt` and add a line to the end


Next, we'll stage our changes
```bash
git status 
git add src.txt
```
<!-- It's always a good practice to check the status of your local repo before staging/commiting -->
<!-- show example of staged v/s unstaged chanegs -->

Finally, we commit our changes and push them to the remote repository
```bash
git commit -m "Updated src.txt"
git push
```
We don't need to specify remote or which branch, since we are already tracking

---

## Merging Branches

```bash
git switch <branch to pull changes into>
git pull
git merge <branch to pull changes from>
```

‚û°Ô∏è If there are no conflicts, it merges cleanly
‚û°Ô∏è Otherwise, you'll resolve conflicts

---

## Merge Conflict Example

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the main branch.
=======
This is your branch.
>>>>>>> your-branch-name
```

‚úÖ Keep what you want\
‚úÖ Delete conflict markers, and then

```bash
git add <filename>
git commit
```

Want to deal with it later?
```bash
git merge --abort
```

---
<!-- _class: follow-along -->
<!-- _footer: üü¢ Follow Along -->

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

Let's simulate a merge conflict by making changes to main
```bash
.\scripts\simulate_changes_to_main.bat
```
This made some changes to the main branch that will now conflict with our changes
```bash
git merge main
```

Once resolved
```bash
git add src.txt
git commit
```

---

## Undoing Mistakes

```bash
git restore <file>
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git revert <commit>
git reflog
```

üßπ Undo changes safely

---

## Stashing

Save current changes for later
```bash
git stash
```
Restore saved changes LIFO order
```bash
git stash pop
```

üß≥ Save temporary changes without committing

---

## How to Find a Git Command
- Official Git documentation: [git-scm.com/docs](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- Use the Git CLI for help:
   ```bash
   git help <command>
   git <command> --help
   ```
   This opens a locally saved version of the documentation.
- On Linux, you can also use:
   ```bash
   `tldr git <command>`
   ```
- For Windows users, try [tldr.sh](https://tldr.sh/) or simply search via ChatGPT or Google.

üí° Tip: Practice self-research and experimentation
